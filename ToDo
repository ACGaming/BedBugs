To Do:

    NOW:

        Change filter in readme to point to 1.11
            Copy that to 1.10 branch
            Check ReadMe version replacement correct (release vs beta)

    LATER:

        DEFINITE:
            Look into bug where game freezes entirely

        MAYBE:
            Fix bug of message not showing correctly via command based kick in singleplayer

            Work on diverting to custom screens instead
            PR onGuiClosedEvent?

        UNLIKELY:
            Investigate source cause of bug for button to fix the actual error
                Teleport/change dimensions (just unload chunk perhaps)
                Block by bed?
                Client/Server desync is the culprit?

    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
